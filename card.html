			<p class="paragraph">	Easily identifiable by the dark stripes on their skin, like tigers on land, the tiger shark is one of the largest shark species.
					They have serrated teeth, allowing them to chew through turtle shells, and nearly anything else they can fit in their mouth.
					Currently the IUCN lists tiger sharks as "Near Threatened" as a result of commercial and recreational overfishing.
